Q1. Explain the different components of MVC - what are their responsibilities?

Model - The model is supposed to store the data.
View - The view is supposed to create the UI/appearance.
Controller - The controller is supposed to liaise with the model and view to bring them together.

Q2. What are some benefits of having an `NSObject` protocol separate from the `NSObject` class?

The benefit of utilising the `NSObject` protocol without a `NSObject` subclass is that you may not always want to have direct access to all of the methods and functionality that `NSObject` gives you, but you may want your protocol to utilise them.

Q3: Given the following person class, create a subclass `LLShoutingPerson` whose designated initializer is `initWithLoudMessage:`. Write the implementation for `LLShoutingPerson`'s initializer.

```objectivec
- (instancetype)initWithLoudMessage:(NSString*)message {
    self = [super initWithMessage:[message uppercaseString]];

    return self;
}
```
