1. What is it mean when you say a language is object-oriented and why could it be considered an improvement over a procedural language?

Object-oriented programming languages are languages that have been designed around the OOP paradigm. OOP is a way of structuring your code to promote reusability, extensibility, modularity and performance. Procedural programming is not a sustainable way of programming large applications because it can get messy very fast.

2. What are structures and why are they useful?

Structures are helpful because they allow you to combine and store (copy) data items of different types.

> Objective-C arrays allow you to define type of variables that can hold several data items of the same kind but structure is another user-defined data type available in Objective-C programming which allows you to combine data items of different kinds.

3. What is the difference between an instance method and a class method and how do you differiate the two?

An instance method is accessed through an initialised instance of an object. A class method is a function that can be accessed outside of an initialized instance of an object. `+ (void)` vs `- (void)`.
