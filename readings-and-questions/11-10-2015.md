Q2. What is the difference in a Core Location course versus the heading of the phone? How might you use these values?

Depends if you're interested in which direction a vehicle is pointed or the direction the vehicle is moving in.

>So are you interested in the direction a vehicle is pointed, or the direction it is moving in? This is less relevant with a vehicle such as a car (being driven well), but can be relevant for a hiker, and critically important for a boater, as boats can have drift introduced by currents and winds.
