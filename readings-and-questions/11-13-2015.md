Q1. What is a deadlock? What happens to your application if you have a deadlock in it?

A deadlock occurs when the waiting queue is still holding on to another resource that the first needs before it can finish. Nothing will progress if there is a deadlock in our application.

Q2. In GDC, what is a barrier? Why would you want to use something like dispatchbarrierasync ?

Barrier statements are used in concurrent queues. Those concurrent queues are queues to which you can submit multiple tasks and they are allowed to run parallel. But sometimes you want to submit something to that queue that needs to lock everything else in the queue because it needs to run alone, so stuff you submit with barrier basically wait for everything in the queue to be completed and then it locks everyone else and executes. In the end release everyone else again.

This is useful for example on read/write operations, in which you can have multiple read operations going on in a concurrent queue, but when you have to write something, you send it as a barrier, so that it blocks every other read while it is writing.
