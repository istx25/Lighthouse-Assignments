Q1. Why do you think we need to archive and unarchive data to write it in a persistent manner? Why not just "save" the data as it exists in the object?

Because we need to encode objects (and primative/scalar values) into an architecture-independent format that can be stored in a file.

Q2. What possible reasons might a failure occur when trying to save some data on disk? How do you find out what went wrong and how to display this to the user?

A failure could occur if the device ran out of space. We can find out what the problem was using a NSError and then responding to that error by displaying a UIAlertController or something of that nature to the user.

Q3. NSUserDefaults can persistent data... so why not use only NSUserDefaults for all our data saving needs?

Though NSUserDefaults can persist data, it is not secure. NSUserDefaults should only be used to persist app preferences and alike.

Q4. If you add an image or file to a project like you did for your previous projects, how and where is this data stored?

The bundle.

Q5. Sometimes when debugging a simulator project you need to access the simulator's file system to see what type of data you are saving. Open up the simulator's file system and take a look at your projects files to see where your data is being stored.
